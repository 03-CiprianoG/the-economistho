# Features:

<b>Simple authentication system</b>

By using mongoose, passport and express-session the user is able to signup, login and authenticate himself.
<b>The Application won't show any data if the user is not logged in.</b> (assignment rule).

<b>Web scraping system</b>

Through an endpoint it is possible to gather information and data about the page the fetch call is pointing to, (e.g Images, Texts, Links… ).
The response’s data is loaded with the “Cheerio“ Library, then some configuration will map through the Cheerio’s Object and pull out the sorted data.
<b>The Application does not actually needs the scraped data but it was required for the assignment</b> (assignment rule).

<b>Cloning system</b>

By using the useEffect React hook, every time the page renders, the React App will trigger an axios api post request which point to an express route, with a payload which contains the current URL’s path.
The express route on the server will then combine the base Url of the website and the path the user is currently on, and by fetching that result, the response’s data will be the index.html document rendered in that page, the data will be sent to the client and injected in the Html document rendered by React.
In this way the index.html of our React App will ever be the same as the html document of whatever website we are pointing to in the express route fetch request. Endpoint: {server_url}/fetch-html<p>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
